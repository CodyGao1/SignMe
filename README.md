# Yolov7 Tensorflow Js
This repository [*WIP*] is an implementation of Yolov7 in Javascript.

This project has a yolov7-tiny  model converted to tensorflow.js [(here)](https://github.com/hugozanini/yolov7-tfjs/tree/master/public/yolov7_web_model) and a  code to do inferences in real-time from the webcam.

**The only thing needed to finish the solution is to implement the [non_max_suppression](https://github.com/hugozanini/yolov7-tfjs/blob/14822bccfba3d0556f238f2b1cec2af971d9e656/src/App.jsx#L48) function properly. There are logical flaws that I did not managed to solve yet.  Feel free to contribute :)**
